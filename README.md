# Blackjack OOP Project
A python project I wrote to enhance my OOP skills, as well as my familarity with the Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook environments. It is a text-based game of Blackjack, involving one user as a Player, and a pre-programmed Dealer. I've been learning OOP for a while, and so I wanted to write a capstone project to summarise my understanding of the skills and practices I learned

I wrote two different card games, one version of Blackjack in Jupyter, and one is a version of WAR written in VS Code. It was my first time using Jupyter Notebook and I would highly reccomend it. I found that it was very useful during development so that I could see both my code and the results side by side. Running code cell by cell was also very helpful that other editors like VSCode do not have. Instead of having to recompile the entire program, it was very helpful to compile small bits at a time for testing purposes. 

Some of the downsides I found from my own experience was the lack of support that you get from your typical IDE. Furthermore, I caught myself getting into the bad habit of writing duplicate code in cells sometimes, however this isn't necessarily a knock on Jupyter but rather a habit that I cleaned up on after a while.
