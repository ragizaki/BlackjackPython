# Blackjack OOP Project
A python project I wrote to enhance my OOP skills, as well as my familarity with the Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook environments. It is a text-based game of Blackjack, involving one user as a Player, and a pre-programmed Dealer.
I wrote two different card games, one version of Blackjack in Jupyter, and one is a version of WAR written in VS Code.
