    "## Blackjack Rules\n",
    "Below are the rules for the version of Blackjack you will be playing\n",
    "1. You will place a bet of how many chips you are willing to put up for the round\n",
    "2. You and the dealer will each be dealt two cards\n",
    "3. Only one of the Dealer's cards will be shown\n",
    "4. If you hit, you will receive another card and its value will be added\n",
    "5. Each card has an inherent value (i.e. 2 = 2, King = 10, etc.)\n",
    "6. The goal of the game is to get as close a score to 21 as possible\n",
    "7. If you Bust (go over 21), you automatically lose\n",
    "8. If you are satisfied with your value, you may choose to stand and the Computer will then hit\n",
    "9. The Computer is designed to hit until they meet or exceed the score of 17"
